    <h1>Setting Up Flask Framework</h1>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Flask was installed using pip in a virtual environment. The command used:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install flask</code></pre>

    <h2>Page Creation</h2>
    <p>The webpage was created in an HTML template file and rendered by the Flask application using the <code>render_template</code> function.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Initially, I faced issues with setting up the virtual environment. The solution was to ensure Python was added to the system PATH.</p>
